# Tensor
Tensor is a fork of [Matrix](https://github.com/DimensionalDevelopment/Matrix) with the goal of adding datagen capabilities.

### Depending on Tensor
- Add Jitpack as a repository (if you already haven't)
```gradle
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
```
- Add Tensor as a dependency
```gradle
implementation 'com.github.Maleks-Modding-Studios:Tensor:<commit>'
```
Replace `<commit>` with the latest commit hash, or a tag
